I code a lot. Like really, a lot.

> ...command-line, GUI, and web-based applications, ... Express, React, Flask, MongoDB, SQL, and cross-platform C/C++ ... APIs, UI/UX design, back-end and business logic development, data science, machine learning, deployment, and containerization.

Honestly, you should just open my website or LinkedIn to see
more, but a follow on social media would be just as much
appreciated. :)
